        "My initial project scope on Padlet was a simple RAG that reads the FAQ section of Archives Online, and provides information to users of the RAG Tool. But later on I wanted to try something else that is way beyond my capability, but if successful, would be a practical tool that I will see myself using. That is to convert the PDFs of speeches on the Archives Online website into text using OCR function. Here's a link to the speeches where you can download the PDFs to try: https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/search-result?search-type=advanced&speaker=Ong+Teng+Cheong\n",
        "\n",
        "I had some limitations - AISAY, which I had initially wanted to try out, were still in the midst of preparing the tool for use. Hence, I tried PyTesseract OCR as recommended by Mr Aldrian. Unfortunately, I soon found out that I had a bigger problem - the version of my MAC OS is too outdated. I am unable to download and install the Tesseract packages successfully in my local machine, and I am also unable to install and run Visual Studio Code. The browser version of VS Code is unable to use the terminal function, so that also takes away access. Hence I am trying a workaround by using Google Colab and running Streamlit from Colab instead. But this will mean that the Streamlit link can only be used when the Colab notebook is being run.\n",

        "- To allow users to upload their own PDFs into the tool\n",
        "- To allow for uploading of multiple files\n",
        "- To summarize the text extracted from the PDFs\n",
        "\n",
        "Bonus:\n",
        "- To display the full text of the document after OCR.\n",
        "- Add a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) function after the summary is provided. This function should allow for multiple queries of all uploaded documents until the user types 'exit'.\n",

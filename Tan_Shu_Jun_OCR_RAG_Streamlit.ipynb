But later on I wanted to try something else that is way beyond my capability, but if successful, would be a practical tool that I will see myself using. That is to convert the PDFs of speeches on the Archives Online website into text using OCR function. Here's a link to the speeches where you can download the PDFs to try: https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/search-result?search-type=advanced&speaker=Ong+Teng+Cheong\n",

Unfortunately, I soon found out that I had a bigger problem - the version of my MAC OS is too outdated. I am unable to download and install the Tesseract packages successfully in my local machine, and I am also unable to install and run Visual Studio Code. The browser version of VS Code is unable to use the terminal function, so that also takes away access. Hence I am trying a workaround by using Google Colab and running Streamlit from Colab instead. But this will mean that the Streamlit link can only be used when the Colab notebook is being run.\n",
